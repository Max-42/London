The **London Underground** (also known simply as **the Underground** or by its nickname **the Tube**) is a very fast **rapid transit system** serving London and some parts arround. The **Average speed** of the Tubes are **33 km/h** and is **operated by the London Underground Limited**.

The Underground has its **origins in the Metropolitan Railway**, the world's first underground passenger railway. **Opened on 10 January 1863**, it is now part of the Circle, District, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines. The first line that started to operate underground electric traction trains, the City & South London Railway in 1890, is now part of the Northern line. The network is one of the bussiest metro stations worldwide.

The system's **first tunnels were built just below the ground**, using a cut-and-cover method. Which means they dig a hole build the metro in there and later fill everything else up again. Later, smaller, roughly circular tunnels—which gave rise to its nickname, the Tube—were dug through at a deeper level. The system serves **272 stations** and has **250 miles (400 km) of track.** Despite its name, **only 45% of the system is under the ground**: much of the network in the outer environs of London is on the surface in addition, the Underground does not cover most southern parts of Greater London, and there are only 33 stations south of the River Thames.
