<h1 id="geschichte">Geschichte</h1>
<p><img alt="Chandni-Chowk" src="../assets/images/geschichte/visual.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>1886</strong> - The construction of Tower Bridge began on 22 April.</p>
<p><strong>1894</strong> - Tower Bridge was opened by the Prince and Princess of Wales with great celebrations, on 30 June.</p>
<p><strong>1910</strong> - The high-level Walkways, which were designed so that the public could still cross the Bridge when it was raised, were closed due to lack of use.</p>
<p><strong>1912</strong> - During a stunt, Frank McClean flew between the bascules and the high-level Walkways in his Short seaplane. He then proceeded to fly under at least three other bridges on his way to Westminster.</p>
<p><strong>1952</strong> - The number 78 London bus driven by Albert Gunter on its way across the Bridge, had to leap from one bascule to the other when the Bridge began to rise.</p>
<p><strong>1976</strong> - Tower Bridge switches to electrified hydraulics, rather than the steam-driven system it was originally powered by.</p>
<p><strong>1977</strong> - Tower Bridge was painted red, white and blue to celebrate the Queen's Silver Jubilee. The original colour of the Bridge was a chocolate brown colour.</p>
<p><strong>1982</strong> - Tower Bridge opened to the public for the first time since 1910, with a permanent exhibition inside called The Tower Bridge Experience.</p>
<p><strong>2012</strong> - Playing a focal point in the London Olympics, this year saw the Olympic rings suspended from the Walkways, and James Bond and ‘the Queen’ fly through in a helicopter during the Opening Ceremony.</p>
