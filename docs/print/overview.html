<h2 id="the-tower-bridge">The Tower Bridge</h2>
<p><strong>Tower Bridge</strong> is a drawbridge in London. It crosses the River Thames near the Tower of London. It allows ships through the bridge deck when is raised at an angle in the centre.</p>
<p>The north side of the bridge is Tower Hill, and the south side of the bridge comes down into Bermondsey, an area in Southwark. Tower Bridge is far more visible than London Bridge, which people often mistake it for. Many tourists go to London to see the Tower Bridge. It has its own exhibition centre in the horizontal walkway. This gives one of the best vantage points in London.</p>
<p>The "bascules" are the surfaces raised to allow tall ships to pass through: this happens about 900 times per year. The bridge's decks (bascules) can be raised to 83° from the horizontal.</p>

<h2 id="the-london-eye">The London Eye</h2>
<p><img alt="The London eye" src="../assets/images/sights/london-eye.jpg" /></p>
<p>The London Eye, or the Millennium Wheel, is a cantilevered observation wheel <strong>on the South Bank of the River Thames in London</strong>. It is Europe's tallest cantilevered observation wheel, and is the <strong>most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom</strong> with over <strong>3 million visitors annually</strong>. It has made many appearances in popular culture.</p>
<p>The structure is <strong>135 metres</strong> (443 ft) <strong>tall</strong> and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft). When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel. Its height was surpassed by the 160 metres (525 ft) Star of Nanchang in 2006, the 165 metres (541 ft) Singapore Flyer in 2008, and the 167 metres (548 ft) High Roller (Las Vegas) in 2014. Supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the taller Nanchang and Singapore wheels, the Eye is described by its operators as "the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel".</p>
<p>The London Eye <strong>used to offer the highest public viewing point in London</strong> until it was superseded by the 245-metre-high (804 ft) observation deck on the 72nd floor of The Shard, which opened to the public on 1 February 2013.</p>
<h2 id="big-ben">Big Ben</h2>
<p><img alt="Big Ben" src="../assets/images/sights/bigben.jpg" /></p>
<p>Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the striking clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London, England, and the name is frequently extended to refer also to the clock and the clock tower. The official name of the tower in which Big Ben is located was originally the Clock Tower, but it <strong>was renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012</strong> to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.</p>
<p>Big Ben is the largest of the tower's five bells and weighs 13.5 long tons (13.7 tonnes; 15.1 short tons). It was the largest bell in the United Kingdom for 23 years. The origin of the bell's nickname is open to question; it may be named after Sir Benjamin Hall, who oversaw its installation, or heavyweight boxing champion Benjamin Caunt. Four quarter bells chime at 15, 30 and 45 minutes past the hour and just before Big Ben tolls on the hour. The clock uses its original Victorian mechanism, but an electric motor can be used as a backup.</p>
<p>The tower is a British cultural icon <strong>recognised all over the world.</strong> It is one of the most prominent symbols of the United Kingdom and parliamentary democracy, and it is often used in the establishing shot of films set in London. The clock tower has been part of a Grade I listed building since 1970 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.</p>

<p><strong>1886</strong> - The construction of Tower Bridge began on 22 April.</p>
<p><strong>1894</strong> - Tower Bridge was opened by the Prince and Princess of Wales with great celebrations, on 30 June.</p>
<p><strong>1910</strong> - The high-level Walkways, which were designed so that the public could still cross the Bridge when it was raised, were closed due to lack of use.</p>
<p><strong>1912</strong> - During a stunt, Frank McClean flew between the bascules and the high-level Walkways in his Short seaplane. He then proceeded to fly under at least three other bridges on his way to Westminster.</p>
<p><strong>1952</strong> - The number 78 London bus driven by Albert Gunter on its way across the Bridge, had to leap from one bascule to the other when the Bridge began to rise.</p>
<p><strong>1976</strong> - Tower Bridge switches to electrified hydraulics, rather than the steam-driven system it was originally powered by.</p>
<p><strong>1977</strong> - Tower Bridge was painted red, white and blue to celebrate the Queen's Silver Jubilee. The original colour of the Bridge was a chocolate brown colour.</p>
<p><strong>1982</strong> - Tower Bridge opened to the public for the first time since 1910, with a permanent exhibition inside called The Tower Bridge Experience.</p>
<p><strong>2012</strong> - Playing a focal point in the London Olympics, this year saw the Olympic rings suspended from the Walkways, and James Bond and ‘the Queen’ fly through in a helicopter during the Opening Ceremony.</p>
